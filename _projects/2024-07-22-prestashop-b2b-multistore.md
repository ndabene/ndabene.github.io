  A major distributor needed to consolidate multiple B2B sales channels into a single, scalable e-commerce platform. The solution required distinct storefronts for different customer segments, complex pricing rules, custom order workflows, and seamless integration with their existing ERP system.

  Key challenges included:
  - Customizing PrestaShop to support true multi-store functionality with shared and distinct product catalogs, customer groups, and pricing.
  - Implementing a robust ERP integration for real-time inventory, order synchronization, and customer data management.
  - Developing custom modules for B2B-specific features like credit limits, tiered pricing, and quick order forms.
  - Ensuring high performance and scalability for thousands of SKUs and concurrent B2B users.
  - Managing complex user roles and permissions across different B2B entities.

  My team and I engineered a highly customized PrestaShop multi-store solution:
  - **Core PrestaShop Customization:** Deep modifications to PrestaShop's core to enable advanced multi-store capabilities, including custom themes and modules for each B2B entity.
  - **ERP Integration Layer:** Developed a dedicated API layer using Symfony to facilitate real-time bidirectional data exchange with the client's ERP system (SAP).
  - **Custom B2B Modules:** Built bespoke modules for features such as custom product configurators, bulk order entry, personalized dashboards, and approval workflows.
  - **Performance Tuning:** Implemented extensive caching strategies (Redis, Varnish), optimized database queries, and fine-tuned server configurations to handle high traffic volumes.
  - **Scalable Infrastructure:** Deployed the solution on AWS, utilizing auto-scaling groups, load balancers, and managed database services to ensure high availability and scalability.
