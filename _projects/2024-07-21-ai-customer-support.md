title: AI-Powered Customer Support Integration
tagline: Integrating machine learning for automated customer support in a legacy PHP application.
client_type: Enterprise Software Company
duration: 6 months
team_size: 5 developers (2 AI/ML, 3 PHP)
technologies: ["Python", "TensorFlow", "PHP", "Symfony", "REST API", "AWS Lambda", "Natural Language Processing"]
business_impact_score: 8 # Scale of 1-10
business_context: |
  The client, a large enterprise software provider, was struggling with high volumes of customer support inquiries, leading to long response times and increased operational costs. Their existing PHP application lacked intelligent automation capabilities, requiring manual triage and response for most tickets.
technical_challenges: |
  Key challenges included:
  - Integrating Python-based ML models into an existing PHP/Symfony application without disrupting current operations.
  - Developing a robust and scalable API for real-time interaction with the ML service.
  - Handling diverse customer inquiry types and ensuring high accuracy in automated responses.
  - Implementing a feedback loop for continuous model improvement.
solutions: |
  My team and I designed and implemented an AI-powered customer support system:
  - **ML Model Development:** Developed and trained a custom NLP model using TensorFlow and Python to classify incoming support tickets and suggest relevant knowledge base articles or automated responses.
  - **API Gateway & Lambda:** Deployed the ML model as a serverless function on AWS Lambda, exposed via an API Gateway, allowing the PHP application to send and receive data efficiently.
  - **Symfony Integration:** Built a new module within the existing Symfony application to interact with the AI API, automatically processing incoming tickets and presenting suggested actions to support agents.
  - **Confidence Scoring & Human Handoff:** Implemented a confidence scoring mechanism; low-confidence predictions were automatically routed to human agents, ensuring quality control.
  - **Continuous Learning:** Established a system for collecting agent feedback on automated responses, which was used to retrain and improve the ML model iteratively.
metrics:
  performance: "40% reduction in average ticket resolution time"
  roi: "20% decrease in customer support operational costs"
  impact: "15% improvement in customer satisfaction scores, significant reduction in agent workload"
