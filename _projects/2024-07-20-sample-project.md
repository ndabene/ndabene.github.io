business_context: |
  The client, a leading global retailer, faced significant performance bottlenecks and scalability issues with their aging PrestaShop e-commerce platform. The monolithic architecture hindered new feature development and led to frequent downtime during peak sales periods, impacting revenue and customer satisfaction.
technical_challenges: |
  Key challenges included: 
  - Decomposing a tightly coupled monolithic application into microservices.
  - Migrating a large, complex database with zero downtime.
  - Implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline for continuous delivery.
  - Optimizing front-end rendering for faster page loads.
  - Ensuring data consistency across distributed services.
solutions: |
  My team and I implemented a comprehensive re-architecture strategy:
  - **Microservices Adoption:** Decomposed the monolith into independent, domain-driven microservices using Symfony for core business logic and Node.js for specific services.
  - **Database Sharding & Replication:** Implemented database sharding and read replicas to distribute load and improve query performance.
  - **Cloud Migration (AWS):** Migrated the entire infrastructure to AWS, leveraging EC2, RDS, S3, and Lambda for serverless functions.
  - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Established a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with GitLab CI, Docker, and Kubernetes for seamless deployments.
  - **Vue.js Frontend:** Rebuilt the critical customer-facing modules using Vue.js for a faster, more responsive user experience.
metrics:
  performance: "70% reduction in page load times"
  roi: "25% increase in conversion rate"
  impact: "99.9% uptime during peak seasons, 15% increase in average order value"
