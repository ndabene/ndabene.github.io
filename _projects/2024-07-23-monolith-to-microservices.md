title: Monolith to Microservices Migration
tagline: Leading the strategic migration of a large monolithic application to a microservices architecture.
client_type: Fintech Startup
duration: 12 months
team_size: 10 developers (5 Backend, 3 Frontend, 2 DevOps)
technologies: ["PHP", "Symfony", "Go", "Kubernetes", "Docker", "Kafka", "PostgreSQL", "AWS"]
business_impact_score: 9
business_context: |
  The client's core financial application, a large PHP monolith, was becoming a bottleneck for feature development, scalability, and reliability. Frequent deployments caused downtime, and the tightly coupled codebase made it difficult to onboard new developers and introduce new technologies.
technical_challenges: |
  Key challenges included:
  - Decomposing a complex, interdependent monolith into manageable, independent microservices.
  - Ensuring data consistency and transaction integrity across distributed services.
  - Implementing robust inter-service communication (synchronous and asynchronous).
  - Migrating existing functionalities incrementally without disrupting live operations.
  - Building a scalable and resilient infrastructure to support the new architecture.
solutions: |
  I led the architectural design and implementation of the migration strategy:
  - **Domain-Driven Decomposition:** Identified core business domains and decomposed the monolith into logical microservices (e.g., User Management, Transaction Processing, Reporting).
  - **Strangler Fig Pattern:** Employed the Strangler Fig pattern to incrementally extract services, routing new traffic to microservices while gradually deprecating monolithic components.
  - **Event-Driven Architecture:** Implemented Kafka for asynchronous communication between services, ensuring loose coupling and resilience.
  - **Containerization & Orchestration:** Containerized all microservices with Docker and orchestrated them using Kubernetes on AWS EKS, enabling automated scaling and self-healing capabilities.
  - **Polyglot Persistence:** Utilized PostgreSQL for relational data and explored NoSQL databases for specific service needs.
  - **Automated CI/CD:** Established a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for each microservice, enabling independent deployments.
metrics:
  performance: "80% reduction in deployment time, 99.99% uptime achieved"
  roi: "30% increase in developer productivity, significant reduction in infrastructure costs due to optimized resource utilization"
  impact: "Faster time-to-market for new features, improved system stability and resilience, enhanced developer experience."
