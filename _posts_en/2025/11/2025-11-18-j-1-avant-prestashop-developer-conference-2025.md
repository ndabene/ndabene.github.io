faq:
- question: What is the PrestaShop Developer Conference and why is it so important?
  answer: The PrestaShop Developer Conference is THE annual gathering of the PrestaShop community where developers, contributors, and enthusiasts meet to discover the project's future directions. This is where feedback is shared (like on the recently released PrestaShop 9), where experts pass on their knowledge, and where the community grows stronger. After 15 years in the ecosystem, I can say it's the best place to understand where PrestaShop is heading and how to take advantage of it.
- question: What are the main themes of the 2025 Developer Conference?
  answer: 'Three major themes emerge: feedback on PrestaShop 9 with migration best practices and product vision, technical workshops on modern back-office, Hummingbird, and open source contribution, and finally advanced topics like security, performance, and Artificial Intelligence in e-commerce. Something to satisfy all profiles, from beginner to expert.'
- question: Why attend the Developer Conference even if I'm just starting with PrestaShop?
  answer: Exactly! It's the perfect opportunity to accelerate your learning. The "How to contribute to PrestaShop" sessions are perfect for beginners, you'll meet experienced developers ready to share their tips, and you'll discover best practices before developing bad habits. Plus, you'll build a network that will be valuable throughout your PrestaShop career.
- question: How to get the most out of the online Developer Conference?
  answer: 'Prepare as if you were there in person: test your connection, create a quiet space without distractions, prepare your questions in advance, and above all, actively participate in Q&A sessions! Follow the hashtag #PrestaShopDevConf2025 to interact with the community in real-time. The advantage of virtual? You can take detailed notes and even review certain sessions.'
- question: What are the most anticipated sessions of this 2025 edition?
  answer: Without hesitation, the feedback on PrestaShop 9! Everyone wants to understand how to migrate safely, learn best practices, and discover the roadmap for upcoming versions. The future of the front-office is also a hot topic, especially with the evolution of the Hummingbird theme. And personally, I'm very curious about the AI sessions - this field is radically transforming how we design e-commerce.
- question: Is PrestaShop really free?
  answer: Yes! PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce CMS and 100% free. You only pay for hosting and, if needed, premium modules that enhance your store. It's one of the platform's great strengths.
- question: How to prepare effectively for the Developer Conference?
  answer: 'My advice: check out the program now and identify your 3-4 must-attend sessions. Note your questions about PrestaShop 9, security, or anything that intrigues you. If you''re attending in person, prepare your business cards and a power bank (trust me, the days are long!). And above all, come with an open mind: the best discoveries often come from impromptu conversations.'

# Countdown to PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025: What Awaits Us!

## 🧠 The countdown is almost over

Tomorrow. **Tomorrow** is the big day.

After weeks of waiting, the **PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025** finally opens its doors. And honestly, I can barely contain my excitement.

After 15 years of developing, optimizing, and tinkering with PrestaShop in every possible way, I can tell you this: Developer Conferences are not just technical events. They are the moments when the platform's future takes shape before our eyes. Where innovations come to life. Where the community vibrates in unison.

This year, the stakes are particularly high. **PrestaShop 9** has just been released, AI is becoming part of our practices, and security questions have never been more critical. In short, this 2025 edition promises to be memorable.

So on the eve of the big day, let's take a tour together of what awaits us. Whether you're a freelance developer, agency-based, open source contributor, or simply curious about tech e-commerce, this event is for you.

## ⚡ The Dev Conf: much more than a series of slides

### The beating heart of the community

For those who have never participated in a Developer Conference, let me explain why it's so different from a traditional conference.

A Dev Conf is not just PowerPoint presentations and product demos. It's **the moment when the community meets physically**. Where we finally put a face to those GitHub usernames we've been seeing for years. Where we discuss real problems, real solutions, over coffee or beer.

**This is where everything happens**:

- **Innovation takes shape**: The project's future directions are unveiled. You won't read about them in a changelog three months later, you discover them live, with explanations from the teams who designed them.

- **Knowledge flows**: Experts share their tips, their failures (yes, their failures too!), their discoveries. You leave with solutions to problems you hadn't even encountered yet.

- **The community grows stronger**: These connections made during the Dev Conf are the ones who will help you on Slack, answer your GitHub issues, and maybe become your business partners tomorrow.

### Why this edition is special

2025 marks a turning point for PrestaShop. Version 9 is here with its share of structural changes, and the stakes around performance, security, and AI have never been more pressing.

**This Dev Conf is your opportunity to get ahead.** While others wait for official documentation, you'll have already understood the new architectures, tested new approaches, and exchanged directly with those who designed them.

## 🚀 What awaits you tomorrow

I've reviewed [the official program](https://events.prestashop.com/e/prestashop-developer-conference-2025/en/sessions), and honestly, this edition looks exceptional. Three major themes emerge:

### PrestaShop 9 and product vision

**This is THE session nobody wants to miss.** PrestaShop 9 has just been released, and the team will share feedback, migration best practices, pitfalls to avoid, and especially the roadmap for upcoming versions. It's the opportunity to hear directly from the teams about the platform's future.

### Technical workshops and best practices

The heart of a Dev Conf! Practical sessions on modern back-office, the Hummingbird theme, and how to contribute to the open source project. A great way to concretely level up your skills.

### Security, Performance, and AI

The three pillars of modern e-commerce. How to protect your stores, optimize performance, and integrate Artificial Intelligence into your workflows. Critical topics that define tomorrow's e-commerce.

**And a personal pride**: with BusinessTech and PrestaModule, we'll have the chance to speak at this edition. It's an honor to share our experience with the community!

**The competitive advantage**: The information you'll gather tomorrow won't be in blogs for several weeks. You'll be among the first to know, to understand, to master. And in our field, this head start is gold.

**The network**: The solution to your next problem might be in a conversation around a corner. These human connections are often more valuable than the sessions themselves.
