# Managing Your PrestaShop Store in Natural Language (with MCP)

## Introduction

Imagine: you're an e-merchant, sitting at your desk after a long day.
Instead of getting lost in the menus of your PrestaShop back-office, you simply write:

> "Export this quarter's sales and send them to my accountant."

And a few seconds later… it's done.
No unnecessary clicks, no tedious manipulation — just a natural conversation with your store.

This vision is becoming reality.
With the **MCP Server** launched by PrestaShop and the **MCP Tools+** developed by **BusinessTech/PrestaModule**, we're entering the era of **conversational management**.
AI is no longer just analyzing: it acts. And this is a major turning point for the entire e-commerce ecosystem.

## ⚡ AI Moves from Words to Action

Managing a PrestaShop store is often a balancing act between creativity and repetitive technical tasks.
We spend time configuring, exporting, adjusting, following up… at the expense of strategy.

### The problem: an AI without hands

Tools like ChatGPT or Claude already know how to advise:
> "Run a promo for your loyal customers"
> "Optimize your dormant stock"

But the problem is they **can't act**.
They remain brilliant "brains"… without "hands".

### The solution: a bridge between AI and your store

This is exactly where the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** comes in.
Designed to create a **secure bridge** between AI and your systems, it allows an AI to **understand a request in natural language and execute it concretely** — while respecting security and privacy rules.

## 🧩 The MCP Server – The Foundation of a New Dialogue Between AI and Store

The **MCP Server**, developed by PrestaShop, constitutes the **technical foundation** of natural language management.
It doesn't provide business functions itself, but manages the **communication and security** between your store and the various **tools** compatible with the protocol.

On **November 19, 2025**, PrestaShop will publish its **first official MCP Tools**: a set of basic tools allowing interaction with the store (reading products, customers, orders, etc.) via natural language.
These tools represent the first functional building block of a larger future ecosystem.

---

## 🧠 What is MCP Tools+?

At **BusinessTech/PrestaModule**, we're exploring **MCP Tools+** as a **premium extension** of these basic tools.
The goal is to add **advanced tools** for merchants and agencies, to enrich the analysis and management capabilities offered by MCP.

These tools focus on richer data: **sales, margins, customer behavior**, performance indicators… and many more features to come.

**MCP Tools+** doesn't perform direct actions: it's the **LLM** (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) that interprets the command and orchestrates execution through available tools.
MCP Tools+ acts as a **context and business intelligence amplifier**, serving more fluid, readable and intuitive e-commerce.

---

## 💡 Natural Language as a Super-Power

The real change doesn't only come from technology — it comes from **natural language**.
This is the moment when humans no longer need to adapt to the machine. The machine understands humans.

PrestaShop tools would handle the basics: reading products, customers, orders.
MCP Tools+ would add the analytical and contextual layer: sales, margins, segmentation, trends.
And it's the LLM that, from all this, would actually execute the command.

Result: we move from *reactive* mode (click, search, execute) to *proactive* mode (ask, understand, get).
A gentle but powerful revolution for productivity.

## 🧮 3 Concrete Use Cases Made Possible

### 📊 1. Quarterly Sales Export

> "Export last quarter's sales and send them to my accountant."

👉 A **PrestaShop tool** extracts product data.
👉 An **MCP Tools+** provides advanced indicators: sales, margins, average cart, evolution.

A 15-minute task reduced to a simple natural sentence.

### 🎯 2. Reward Your Best Customers

> "Identify the top 10 customers over the last 30 days and prepare a thank-you campaign."

👉 A **PrestaShop tool** reads customer and order data.
👉 An **MCP Tools+** enriches the reading with segmentation and purchasing behavior.
👉 The **LLM** then formulates actions to take via other third-party tools.

## 🌍 Impact for Web Agencies

For **PrestaShop-specialized agencies**, this evolution is a strategic opportunity.

Instead of limiting themselves to development or support, they can become **conversational flow architects**:
- design custom tools for their clients,
- create analyses and insights on demand,
- or even train merchants to manage their store by voice.

It's a transformation of posture: less raw technique, more **business value and consulting**.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion – Conversational E-commerce

PrestaShop's **MCP Server** and BusinessTech's **MCP Tools+** concepts open a new page in e-commerce history:
that of a store **managed in natural language**, where AI becomes a true action partner.

Merchants save time.
Agencies gain a new value proposition.
And the ecosystem gains technological maturity that puts humans back at the center.

> AI doesn't replace the merchant. It gives them back their power of action.

And you?
What would be **your first natural command** to your PrestaShop store?
