faq:
- question: Why has bot traffic become a major problem for Shopify merchants?
  answer: Because Shopify prevents the use of Cloudflare proxy, merchants cannot filter traffic at the source. Bots reach their servers and pollute their analytics and advertising data.
- question: How much e-commerce traffic is generated by bots in 2025?
  answer: According to Radware and Security Magazine, 57% of global e-commerce traffic comes from bots, of which 31% are malicious. On Shopify, some stores reach 73% non-human traffic.
- question: Why does advertising data become unusable?
  answer: Bots send false signals to Meta and Google pixels, distorting conversion rates, CPA, and attribution models. Algorithms learn to target bots instead of customers.
- question: What role does Cloudflare play in bot protection?
  answer: Cloudflare filters HTTP traffic upstream through its WAF and behavioral intelligence. But Shopify prohibits its use in proxy mode, reserved for Enterprise customers.
- question: How does PrestaShop differ on this point?
  answer: PrestaShop allows freely activating Cloudflare proxy, using the full WAF, and configuring proactive bot filtering. Merchants retain control of their DNS and edge security.
- question: Does Shopify's new 'Human or Bot' filter fix the problem?
  answer: 'No. It''s retrospective filtering: bots are visible in reports, but not blocked. Traffic remains counted and continues to impact advertising pixels.'

# Why Shopify Merchants Can't Properly Track Their Ad Campaigns

Shopify merchants face a **structural challenge**: a massive influx of non-human traffic combined with the inability to use the infrastructure tools necessary to filter it.
The result? Meta and Google Ads campaigns that learn to target... bots.

---

## 📊 What is the Scale of Bot Traffic in E-commerce?

According to the **Radware 2024 Report**, bots represent **57% of global e-commerce traffic**, and **31% of this traffic is malicious** — doubling in two years.
On small Shopify stores, independent analyses conducted on over 200 sites push this proportion to **73%**.

This traffic doesn't correspond to legitimate crawlers: these are scripts that simulate human behavior, browse products, reach checkout... but never buy.

Origin zones are often the same: **Ashburn (Virginia)**, **Buffalo (New York)**, **Santa Clara (California)**, or **Council Bluffs (Iowa)** — locations hosting major cloud data centers.

---

## 🧩 How Do These Bots Corrupt Advertising Data?

Bots distort all marketing indicators:
- **Artificially low conversion rates**: a store going from 5% real to 1.7% "apparent".
- **Biased attribution**: bot traffic is classified as "Direct" instead of real channels.
- **Poisoned pixels**: Meta and Google learn to target automated traffic.

An example cited in [r/FacebookAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1i26h4j/i_cut_bot_traffic_from_90_to_5_in_meta_ads/) shows a bot traffic reduction from **90% to 5%**, resulting in a **42% CPA drop** and **tripled ROAS**.

> "If Meta receives false signals, it learns to target robots. Clean the data, and the algorithm becomes efficient again." — Testimony from a media buyer.

---

## 🔒 Why Doesn't Shopify Allow Blocking Traffic at the Source?

Shopify prohibits activation of **Cloudflare proxy** on custom domains.
When a merchant attempts to activate the "orange cloud," an error appears:
> *"Your domain uses Cloudflare Proxy, which is not supported by Shopify."*

This technical choice has several causes:
- Conflict with SSL certificates and DNS validation managed by Shopify.
- Protection of **Shop Pay** flow, core of the proprietary model.
- Internal use of Cloudflare by Shopify, without accessible configuration.

Result: merchants can **neither activate the WAF**, nor define **Firewall rules**, nor block bot traffic before it reaches their store.

Only **Shopify Plus customers with Cloudflare Enterprise (~$60,000/year)** can activate a partial "Orange-to-Orange" (O2O) solution, with strong limitations: no custom rules, no Workers on `/checkout`, and reduced compatibility.

---

## 🧱 What Are the Consequences for Data Reliability?

Without edge filtering, bots:
- are counted in analytics;
- pollute conversion reports;
- consume advertising budgets.

Shopify did introduce a **"Human or Bot" filter** in its reports since October 2025, but it acts **retrospectively**.
It doesn't block anything in real-time, and its analysis model takes **24 to 48 hours** to classify sessions.

> In other words: merchants discover the problem two days after it has corrupted their pixels.

---

## ⚙️ PrestaShop and Cloudflare: The Opposite Approach

The open architecture of **PrestaShop** offers a striking contrast.
Merchants can activate **Cloudflare in full proxy mode**, giving them access to:
- a **configurable WAF**;
- **dynamic filtering rules**;
- **total DNS control**;
- and **proactive edge protection**.

### Cloudflare and PrestaShop: Total Freedom

Unlike Shopify, PrestaShop allows:
- activating proxy (orange cloud) on all domains;
- blocking malicious IPs, countries, or user-agents;
- configuring the web application firewall (WAF) directly in Cloudflare;
- managing all this from **dedicated PrestaShop modules**.

This openness ensures filtering **before** traffic touches the store — preserving both analytics and advertising pixels.

### A Complete Anti-Bot Ecosystem

PrestaShop also has a wide range of specialized addons:
- **reCAPTCHA/CAPTCHA** on forms and carts
- **Blocking by country/IP**
- **Real-time traffic monitoring**
- **AI analysis modules for bot traffic**

Where Shopify corrects after the fact, PrestaShop prevents the problem.

## ⚖️ Comparison Table: Shopify vs PrestaShop on Bot Traffic Management

| Feature | Shopify | PrestaShop |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| Cloudflare proxy activatable | ❌ No (except Enterprise) | ✅ Yes, without restriction |
| Access to WAF | ❌ No | ✅ Complete via Cloudflare |
| Real-time bot filtering | ❌ No, retrospective filtering | ✅ Yes, at source |
| Anti-bot modules | Limited (post-server Apps) | Extended, proactive |
| Server-side tracking | Partial, biased | Integral via GTM server-side |
| Marketing attribution | Distorted by bot traffic | Reliable, multi-touch possible |

---

## 🧭 Conclusion

Shopify merchants face a systemic distortion: their decisions rest on polluted data.
Their architecture prevents them from defending effectively, unless they invest in Enterprise solutions out of reach for the majority.

PrestaShop demonstrates that an open approach, integrated with Cloudflare, allows eliminating 90% of bot traffic before it affects advertising campaigns — and thus, operating e-commerce on healthy data.

> **The difference lies not in advertising, but in architecture.**
