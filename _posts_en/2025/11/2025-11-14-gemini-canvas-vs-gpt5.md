# Gemini Canvas vs GPT-5: Which Creates the Best Presentation?

## Introduction

Preparing a clear and aesthetic presentation can quickly become time-consuming.
With **Canvas**, its new feature integrated into **Gemini**, Google promises to transform simple text or a URL into a **complete and visual presentation**.

I wanted to test this promise against **GPT-5**, on a concrete case:
> *Create a Google Slides presentation from my article:*
> 👉 [Developer Skills Evolution in 2025](https://nicolas-dabene.fr/en/articles/2025/11/10/evolution-competences-developpeurs/)

The exact prompt I used in both AIs:

> 🧠 **Prompt:**
> "I want to create a Google Slides presentation on https://nicolas-dabene.fr/articles/2025/11/10/evolution-competences-developpeurs/"

The results are very different... and revealing.

## 🎨 Google Gemini's Canvas: Fluid and Automated Creation

Gemini introduces a true **integrated visual creation studio**.
Thanks to **Canvas**, any user can generate a slide deck from text, a link, or even uploaded images.

### 🔧 How It Works

1. Open **Gemini** → **Tools → Canvas** section
2. Paste your topic, text, or URL
3. Click on *Create presentation*
4. Gemini automatically generates:
   - A **structured plan** (introduction, content, conclusion)
   - **Coherent themes** with colors and typography
   - **AI-generated images**
   - And even **LaTeX** if needed for equations or tables

> 💡 Canvas allows you to edit content directly, add slides, then **export to Google Slides** with one click.

### 🎯 What I Got With My Prompt

In a few seconds, Gemini generated:
- Coherent and well-hierarchized slides
- A clean visual identity, based on Google Slides tones
- Relevant visuals evoking the future of development and AI
- A logical plan:
  1. Introduction to context
  2. Skills mutation
  3. New market expectations
  4. AI's role in transformation
  5. Conclusion and perspectives

The result is **clean, readable and immediately usable**.

## 🤖 GPT-5: A More Narrative and Creative Approach

For its part, **GPT-5** produced a more "human" presentation in structure.
Less focused on design, but **richer in content**: each slide had a complete narrative framework, often written like a script.

### What GPT-5 Does Better
- Better **argued synthesis**: it understands the nuances of the source text
- Direct integration possible with **PowerPoint or Google Slides via API**
- Greater freedom in tone and style (storytelling, pedagogy, etc.)

### What It Does Less Well
- No native visual generation (requires a plugin for images)
- Needs **more precise prompt structuring**
- Less fluid if you simply want to "have a ready presentation"

## ⚔️ The Synthetic Comparison

| Criterion | **Gemini Canvas** | **GPT-5** |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Ease of use** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| **Visual style** | Clean, professional | Variable depending on prompt |
| **Content richness** | Medium | High |
| **Plan creativity** | Basic but effective | Structured and narrative |
| **Slides integration** | Native | Via API or export |
| **LaTeX / PDF support** | Yes | Partial |
| **Target audience** | Students, busy pros | Trainers, content creators |

## 📚 Some Inspiring Use Cases

Gemini Canvas is not limited to presentations:
- 🎓 **Students**: transform revision sheets into interactive quizzes
- 💼 **Professionals**: create action plans from meeting notes
- 🧑‍💻 **Developers**: visualize code, logs or AI results

> And thanks to **integrated LaTeX rendering**, scientists can now prepare complex equations without additional software.

## 📂 Test Results

I put the two presentations side by side — **Gemini vs GPT-5** — so you can judge for yourself:

➡️ **Download the presentations:**
- [Google Gemini Version (Slides)](/assets/downloads/blog/2025/11/gemini-canvas-presentation.pdf)
- [GPT-5 Version (PowerPoint)](/assets/downloads/blog/2025/11/gpt5-presentation.pdf)

👉 Each presentation uses the same base, but tone, layout and content density differ radically.

---

## Conclusion

Between Gemini Canvas and GPT-5, there isn't a "best", but **two complementary approaches**:
- **Gemini Canvas** shines through its **simplicity, visual coherence and integration** with Google Slides.
- **GPT-5** excels in **content depth** and **narrative creation**.

For my part, I see Gemini as a **rapid execution tool**, and GPT-5 as a **high value-added assistant** for scripted presentations.
