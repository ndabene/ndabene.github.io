faq:
- question: What is Google Gemini's Canvas?
  answer: Canvas is a feature integrated into Gemini that automatically creates complete
    presentations from text, URL, or images. It generates a structured plan, coherent
    themes with colors and typography, AI-generated images, and even supports LaTeX
    for complex equations.
- question: What are the main differences between Gemini Canvas and GPT-5 for creating
    presentations?
  answer: Gemini Canvas excels in ease of use, native integration with Google Slides,
    and clean, professional visual style with an immediately usable result. GPT-5,
    on the other hand, produces disappointing results that require major rework and
    a very elaborate prompt upfront to be usable.
- question: How do you use Canvas to create a presentation?
  answer: Simply open Gemini, go to Tools → Canvas section, paste your topic, text
    or URL, then click 'Create presentation'. Gemini automatically generates the plan,
    visuals and content, which you can then edit and export to Google Slides in one
    click.
- question: Which tool is best suited for which type of user?
  answer: 'Gemini Canvas is ideal for all users who want to create presentations quickly
    and effectively: students, professionals, trainers. GPT-5 is not recommended for
    visual presentation generation, unless you are willing to spend a lot of time
    on rework and crafting complex prompts.'
- question: Is Claude free?
  answer: Claude offers a limited free version and Pro ($20/month) and Team ($30/month
    per user) subscriptions.
- question: What's the difference between Claude and ChatGPT?
  answer: Claude excels at long tasks and analysis. ChatGPT is more conversational.
    Both are complementary.

# Gemini Canvas vs GPT-5: Which Creates the Best Presentation?

## Introduction

Preparing a clear and aesthetic presentation can quickly become time-consuming.
With **Canvas**, its new feature integrated into **Gemini**, Google promises to transform simple text or a URL into a **complete and visual presentation**.

I wanted to test this promise against **GPT-5**, on a concrete case:
> *Create a Google Slides presentation from my article:*
> 👉 [Developer Skills Evolution in 2025](https://nicolas-dabene.fr/en/articles/2025/11/10/evolution-competences-developpeurs/)

The exact prompt I used in both AIs:

> 🧠 **Prompt:**
> "I want to create a Google Slides presentation on https://nicolas-dabene.fr/articles/2025/11/10/evolution-competences-developpeurs/"

The results are very different... and revealing.

## 🎨 Google Gemini's Canvas: Fluid and Automated Creation

Gemini introduces a true **integrated visual creation studio**.
Thanks to **Canvas**, any user can generate a slide deck from text, a link, or even uploaded images.

### 🔧 How It Works

1. Open **Gemini** → **Tools → Canvas** section
2. Paste your topic, text, or URL
3. Click on *Create presentation*
4. Gemini automatically generates:
   - A **structured plan** (introduction, content, conclusion)
   - **Coherent themes** with colors and typography
   - **AI-generated images**
   - And even **LaTeX** if needed for equations or tables

> 💡 Canvas allows you to edit content directly, add slides, then **export to Google Slides** with one click.

### 🎯 What I Got With My Prompt

In a few seconds, Gemini generated:
- Coherent and well-hierarchized slides
- A clean visual identity, based on Google Slides tones
- Relevant visuals evoking the future of development and AI
- A logical plan:
  1. Introduction to context
  2. Skills mutation
  3. New market expectations
  4. AI's role in transformation
  5. Conclusion and perspectives

The result is **clean, readable and immediately usable**.

## 🤖 GPT-5: A Disappointing and Unusable Result

For its part, **GPT-5** produced a result **significantly below** Gemini Canvas.
Without a **very elaborate and structured prompt upfront**, the generated presentation is **not directly usable**.

### Main Weaknesses
- **Unusable raw output**: requires **major rework** to be presentable
- No native visual generation (requires a plugin for images)
- **Incoherent structure** without a very precise and detailed prompt
- Absent or haphazard layout depending on generations
- Often requires **multiple iterations** to get something correct

### What GPT-5 Can Do (With Much Effort)
- Possible integration with **PowerPoint or Google Slides via API** (but complex setup)
- Interesting narrative potential **if and only if** the prompt is very well crafted
- Can generate dense content, but often too verbose for slides

> ⚠️ **Verdict**: For presentation generation, GPT-5 **is not up to par** with Gemini Canvas. The time saved by automation is lost in rework and adjustments.

## ⚔️ The Synthetic Comparison

| Criterion | **Gemini Canvas** | **GPT-5** |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Ease of use** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
| **Visual style** | Clean, professional | Non-existent without rework |
| **Content richness** | Medium but usable | Too dense, poorly structured |
| **Plan creativity** | Basic but effective | Incoherent without elaborate prompt |
| **Slides integration** | Native (1 click) | Via API (complex) |
| **LaTeX / PDF support** | Yes | Partial |
| **Immediate result** | ✅ Directly usable | ❌ Requires major rework |
| **Target audience** | All users | Experts willing to iterate extensively |

## 📚 Some Inspiring Use Cases

Gemini Canvas is not limited to presentations:
- 🎓 **Students**: transform revision sheets into interactive quizzes
- 💼 **Professionals**: create action plans from meeting notes
- 🧑‍💻 **Developers**: visualize code, logs or AI results

> And thanks to **integrated LaTeX rendering**, scientists can now prepare complex equations without additional software.

## 📂 Test Results

I put the two presentations side by side — **Gemini vs GPT-5** — so you can judge for yourself:

➡️ **Download the presentations:**
- [Google Gemini Version (Slides)](/assets/downloads/blog/2025/11/gemini-canvas-presentation.pdf)
- [GPT-5 Version (PowerPoint)](/assets/downloads/blog/2025/11/gpt5-presentation.pdf)

👉 Each presentation uses the same base, but tone, layout and content density differ radically.

---

## Conclusion

Between Gemini Canvas and GPT-5, **the verdict is clear**: **Gemini Canvas wins by a wide margin** for presentation creation.

- **Gemini Canvas** delivers an **immediately usable result**, with visual coherence, clear structure, and native integration with Google Slides. It's the ideal tool for anyone looking to save time.

- **GPT-5**, on the other hand, **disappoints on this task**: without a very elaborate prompt upfront, the result requires **significant rework** that cancels out the expected productivity gain. It is not suited for visual presentation generation.

**My recommendation**: for creating presentations quickly and effectively, **Gemini Canvas is the obvious choice**. GPT-5 might occasionally serve as a complement to refine textual content, but certainly not as a primary slide creation tool.
