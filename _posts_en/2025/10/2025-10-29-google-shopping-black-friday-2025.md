# Google Shopping & Black Friday 2025: Complete Guide for PrestaShop

You've surely noticed: each year, Black Friday arrives with the eagerness of a child before Christmas. For e-merchants, this period represents much more than a simple traffic surge - it's a commercial marathon where every detail counts. And guess where much of this battle is played? On Google Shopping.

In the 15 years I've accompanied e-commerce projects, I've observed a remarkable transformation: Google Shopping has evolved from a simple price comparison tool to a true platform where most purchase decisions are made. In 2025, **70% of Google Ads advertising revenue comes directly from Google Shopping**. This isn't a coincidence - it's a reality you must master.

## Introduction

Black Friday 2025 promises to be different from previous years. European consumers are no longer just seeking low prices - they want transparency, quality, and a smooth shopping experience. This evolution creates an extraordinary opportunity for PrestaShop merchants who understand Google Shopping's importance.

This year, European consumers plan to spend an average of **€400 each**, with **36% active participation**. In France, **70% of shoppers explicitly search for the best deals**. But here's the crucial point: they don't find these deals by chance. They search for them on Google.

## The 2025 European Black Friday Context: Understanding Your Customers

### The European Shopping Revolution

European Black Friday doesn't resemble its American cousin. In North America, it's a one-time event on November 29. In Europe? It's an **extended shopping strategy**.

Imagine Black Friday as a sporting event: in America, it's an intense one-day sprint. In Europe, it's a marathon spread over several weeks. **61% of European consumers plan and budget their purchases well in advance**. They don't rush headlong on November 28 - they mentally prepare, consult reviews, compare prices.

This trend creates a fascinating challenge: how to remain visible and relevant during this extended evaluation period? Answer: through Google Shopping.

### National Variations: Adapting Your Strategy

Each European country has its own shopping personality. Understanding these nuances isn't academic - it's strategically crucial.

**In France**, shoppers seek authenticity. With an average budget of **€320**, French consumers value quality and storytelling. Winning categories? **45% turn to ready-to-wear** and **38% to beauty and hygiene**. This is reassuring for French PrestaShop merchants - there's no magic sector, just a necessity for excellent product presentation.

**Germany**, as an economic power, shows different trends. Higher budget (about **€450 on average**), more structured and rational approach. **54% of German consumers research online before buying**. For these meticulously organized shoppers, Google Shopping becomes a validation tool - they'll only see products that exactly match their criteria.

**The United Kingdom** reveals an impressive mobile trend: **71% of Black Friday transactions happen on smartphone**. If you don't offer a mobile-optimized Google Shopping experience, you're leaving money on the table.

## Google Shopping in 2025: The Evolutions That Change Everything

### A Platform Transformed by AI

If I had described Google Shopping five years ago, it would have sufficed to say: "It's a price comparison tool." Today, it's radically different.

Google Shopping metamorphosed in 2025. Integration of **advanced AI** and **voice features with Google Assistant** transforms the user experience. It's no longer simply a search tool - it's an **intelligent discovery platform**.

Concretely, here's what this means: a customer asks Google Assistant "Find me a winter coat for Switzerland" and receives not only a product list, but also an **intelligently AI-generated summary** of points to consider for that specific climate. This granular personalization directly benefits merchants who understand how to properly structure their product data.

### Key New Features

**The dedicated "Deals" page** constitutes a major advance. Imagine a space where all discounted products naturally appear, organized by relevance and attractiveness. For Black Friday, this represents an exceptional showcase. Your promotions must appear there - it's a matter of commercial visibility.

**Voice search and mobility** merge to create smooth shopping journeys. "I'm looking for a cheap 10-inch tablet" - a few seconds later, results appear on the smartphone screen. No clicks, no complications. Just relevant products.

## European Performance Data: Real Numbers

To make intelligent decisions, we need data.

Here are the **real 2025 European Google Shopping benchmarks**:

- **Average cost per click**: €2.85 (much more affordable than three years ago)
- **Average conversion rate**: 1.76% (twice higher than classic text ads)
- **Mobile share of revenue**: 65% (major)
- **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) by sector**:
  - Automotive: 10.61 (excellent margins)
  - Toys: 8.82 (Black Friday sector par excellence)
  - Office supplies: 7.09

These numbers aren't there to impress - they tell you something important: **people are buying via Google Shopping**. A lot. It's a channel you can no longer ignore.

## Configuration and Optimization: The Practical Path

### Preparation Phase (October - Early November)

Thinking about Google Shopping two days before Black Friday is like buying your Santa Claus costume on December 24. Too late. Real preparation starts now.

**Step 1: Audit Your Catalog**

Start with a simple question: are all my products correctly configured in Google Merchant Center? Not just price and image - I'm talking about detailed elements like:

- Are product descriptions complete and persuasive?
- Do product images meet Google standards (minimum 1000x1000px)?
- Are categories correctly assigned?
- Do you have product identifiers (GTIN/EAN) for your items?

This verification takes time, but it avoids dozens of product rejections during Black Friday peak.

**Step 2: Mobile-First Optimization**

With **65% of European revenue coming from mobile**, ignoring mobile means losing two-thirds of your potential sales.

For PrestaShop, this means:
- Verify your theme is fully responsive
- Test product page loading on 4G (not just WiFi)
- Ensure checkout process works perfectly on small screen
- Check product label visibility on mobile

### Execution Phase (November 15-27)

**Intelligent Segmentation**

Here begins the actual strategy. Instead of considering all your products the same way, create strategic groups:

**By commercial margin**: "High margin", "Standard margin", "Loss leader"
**By seasonality**: "Black Friday", "Christmas", "Winter 2025"
**By performance**: "Top performer", "New", "To relaunch"

Each group will receive different marketing treatment. "Top performer" products with "High margin" will receive a larger advertising budget, while loss leaders generate general traffic.

**Promotion Activation**

Google Shopping allows exporting your promotional codes with automatic activation dates. Think about European "Cyber Week" (November 28 - December 1). Each day can have its own promotional timing.

### Post-Event Phase (December 2-15)

Black Friday is only half the story. The real magic happens **after** - when you analyze what worked.

**Customer Review Collection**

You just sold a lot. Perfect. Now, activate review collection. Why? Because product reviews increase conversions by **+17%**. In Europe, **94% of purchases concern 4-5 star rated products**.

Google has automated collection systems. Use them. Each customer review becomes social proof for next year.

## Structuring Your Data: The Foundation of Everything

Here, we enter technical details - don't panic, it's simpler than it seems.

### Google Merchant Center Feed Format

Your PrestaShop catalog must be transformed into a "feed" that Google can understand. This resembles a sophisticated Excel file containing all your products with their attributes.

Essential fields for Black Friday:

```
Product ID | Title | Description | Price | Promotion | Stock | Image | Category | Availability
ABC123 | Men's Winter Jacket M | Warm, waterproof... | 89.99 | 59.99 | 45 | [URL] | Clothing | in stock
```

Google wants to see clarity. A price, a promotion, quantified stock - no ambiguity.

### Product Title Optimization

For Google Shopping, the title is crucial. Unlike your website where design can compensate for a weak title, on Google Shopping, **text must be king**.

A bad title: "Jacket"
A good title: "Men's Winter Waterproof Jacket XL Black"

See the difference? The second title contains keywords that customers actually search for.

### Images: Your Visual Asset

An image is worth a thousand words - this is particularly true on Google Shopping. **Products with multiple images generate 30% more clicks**.

For Black Friday:
- Main image: product on white or neutral background
- Additional images: worn, details, actual use
- Resolution: minimum 1000x1000px, ideally 1200x1200px
- Format: JPG (more efficient compression)

## The Importance of Reviews and Satisfaction Ratings

Here's an analogy: imagine you enter a restaurant. Two options:

1. An empty restaurant, no online reviews
2. A full restaurant, with hundreds of 4-5 star reviews

Which would you choose? Obviously the second.

On Google Shopping, it's identical. Products with reviews convert much better than new products. Why? Because reviews reduce perceived risk. Someone else bought this product, liked it, recommends it. You can therefore buy with confidence.

**Cascading Review Collection System**

For Black Friday 2025, consider a three-step strategy:

1. **Immediate automated collection** (3-5 days after purchase) - Customers are enthusiastic
2. **Reminder after use** (30 days) - They've had time to really test
3. **Year-end campaign** (45 days) - Last call before final ranking

### Enriched Review Snippets

Google displays "stars" next to your products in search results. **Each additional star increases click rate by 15% on average**. This isn't marketing - it's commercial psychology validated by billions of data points.

## Geographic Optimization for Europe

If you sell simultaneously in France, Germany, and United Kingdom, you must adapt your approach per market.

### Multi-Country Strategy

**For France**:
- Average CPC budget: €2.50
- Focus products: fashion, consumer electronics
- Strategy: quality and storytelling

**For Germany**:
- Average CPC budget: €3.10
- Focus products: electronics, tools
- Strategy: technical specifications and comparison

**For United Kingdom**:
- Average CPC budget: €3.20
- Focus products: recognized brand products
- Strategy: absolute mobile-first

### Shipping Fee Configuration

This is a frustrating point for many customers: discovering shipping fees at the last moment. On Google Shopping, you can display fees transparently.

Better: manage different fees by geographic zone. Delivery to Switzerland costs more than to Île-de-France? Reflect this reality in your fees. This decreases surprises and therefore cart abandonments.

## Mistakes to Avoid (Lessons from Experience)

After 15 years, I've seen merchants make the same mistakes. You can avoid them:

### Mistake #1: Neglecting Feed Quality

The first time you activate Google Shopping, you're tempted to push 10,000 products at once. Resist this instinct. Better to have 500 perfectly configured products than 10,000 approximate products.

**Invest in your data quality**. A product with good description and good images generates more clicks than a generic list.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Mobile

I've mentioned it several times, but it must be crystal clear: **if your site isn't mobile-optimized, you're losing**. Physically check on an iPhone how your product displays.

### Mistake #3: Fixation on Click Rate

More clicks doesn't equal more sales. A click from someone searching for a different product than yours is useless. Better to have 100 clicks from truly interested people than 1,000 clicks from confused visitors.

### Mistake #4: Static Catalog

Your catalog changes constantly: stock running out, fluctuating prices, promotions coming and going. If you don't regularly update Google Merchant Center, Google will display outdated information.

## Key Metrics to Track

Here begins true commercial intelligence. These indicators will tell you if you're winning or losing:

**Conversion Rate (CT)**: What percentage of visitors actually buy? The European benchmark is 1.76%. If you're below, your product presentation needs improvements.

**Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**: For each euro spent on Google Shopping advertising, how much do you earn? A ROAS of 3 means €1 generated €3 of revenue. Benchmark by sector varies enormously.

**Cost per Sale**: Divide your Google Shopping expenses by your number of sales. This tells you the real cost to acquire a customer.

**Stock Turnover**: What happens to your in-stock products after Black Friday? Excellent product but zero sales? There's a problem.

Investment in a quality Google Shopping feed pays back from the first weeks. For Black Friday, it often pays for itself from day one.

## Conclusion: Black Friday Is Now

Black Friday 2025 represents much more than a commercial opportunity - it's a maturity test for your e-commerce strategy. PrestaShop merchants who master Google Shopping don't see Black Friday with anxiety, but with opportunity.

**Here's what to remember**:

Google Shopping has transformed. It's no longer a simple price comparison tool - it's an AI-powered discovery platform where most purchase decisions are made. European consumers, particularly in France and United Kingdom, massively use this tool.

Your customers don't come directly to your site. They search for their product on Google, discover your shop via Google Shopping, then wonder if you're reliable. **Customer reviews then become your ambassador** - they say "yes, buy from this shop" before you've even made acquaintance.

But don't see this as a restriction - **see it as an opportunity**. An optimized presence on Google Shopping in 2025 means:

- Visibility to millions of actively searching customers
- Higher conversion rates thanks to clearly established purchase intent
- Ability to compete with e-commerce giants through intelligent strategy
- Building commercial reputation based on real reviews

Black Friday 2025 is no longer just on your website. It's played on Google Shopping. The time for preparation has arrived.
