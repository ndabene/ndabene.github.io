Doctolib has become in barely twelve years one of French Tech's most remarkable success stories, radically transforming how French people make their medical appointments. Look back at the epic of a startup that revolutionized the digital health sector.

## Origins: A Vision Born from Experience

Doctolib's story begins in **August 2013** with the meeting of four entrepreneurs with complementary profiles. **Stanislas Niox-Chateau**, former tennis champion turned financial analyst at Otium Capital after his HEC studies, carries the initial idea. Strong from his successful experience with La Fourchette, he identifies a major problem in the French healthcare system: the complexity of medical appointment booking.

Stanislas partners with **Jessy Bernal**, **Ivan Schneider** and **Steve Abou-Rjeily** to create Doctolib in December 2013. From the start, the approach is pragmatic: they surround themselves with **50 partner practitioners** (doctors and dentists) who become their first users and provide valuable feedback to refine the product.

## 2014-2016: Solid Foundations

The first year marks a decisive turning point. In **February 2014**, Doctolib raises **€1 million** from historic investors, notably Antoine Freysz and Bertrand Jelensperger. In June, the service is deployed in its first clinic, thus validating the concept.

2015 confirms the potential with a new fundraising of **€4 million** bringing the total to €5 million raised in one year. This growth allows the company to open offices in 10 French cities and double its workforce, going from 50 to 100 employees.

In **2016**, Doctolib crosses a major step with its **establishment in Germany** and a fundraising of **€26 million** from Accel Partners and Bpifrance. This international expansion testifies to the company's European ambition.

## 2017-2018: Acceleration and Consolidation

2017 is marked by sustained growth with a new fundraising of **€26 million** more. But it's in **July 2018** that Doctolib strikes a big blow by acquiring its main French competitor, **MonDocteur**, for approximately €45 million.

This strategic acquisition is crucial: it allows Doctolib to consolidate its leadership position with **55,000 practitioner users** and **20 million patient visits per month**. The new ensemble employs 600 employees and positions itself as "the most used online medical appointment booking service in the world".

## 2019-2020: Consecration and COVID Trial

In **March 2019**, Doctolib reaches the highly coveted status of **French unicorn** with a **€150 million** fundraising that values the company at **over one billion euros**. This milestone coincides with the launch of **teleconsultation** services, developed with 500 partner doctors.

But it's the **COVID-19 pandemic in 2020** that definitively propels Doctolib to the forefront. The platform plays a crucial role in managing the health crisis, notably for organizing **vaccination campaigns**. The explosion of teleconsultation (4.5 million acts between March and September 2020, 45 times more than in 2019) consolidates its position.

## 2021-2022: European Expansion and French Record

In **October 2021**, Doctolib concretizes its European expansion by **acquiring Dottori.it**, one of Italy's main medical appointment booking actors. This acquisition is accompanied by an investment plan of **€250 million** and hiring 500 people in Italy.

**March 15, 2022** marks financial peak with a **mega-fundraising of €500 million** that propels valuation to **€5.8 billion**. Doctolib thus becomes **the best-valued French startup**, surpassing Back Market. This fundraising aims to create 3,500 jobs in France, Germany and Italy over five years.

## 2023: The Trial of Controversies

2023 is marked by a major controversy around the presence of **naturopaths and alternative medicine practitioners** on the platform. Facing medical community criticism denouncing dangerous practices, Doctolib makes a radical decision in **October 2022**: exclude **5,700 practitioners** without ADELI or RPPS number.

This decision, hailed by the medical body, results in a **32% revenue drop** for some excluded naturopaths. But it allows Doctolib to consolidate its medical credibility and refocus on regulated healthcare professionals.

## 2024-2025: The AI Era and March Toward Profitability

In **October 2024**, Doctolib launches a major innovation: the **AI-based Consultation Assistant**. This revolutionary tool automates note-taking during consultations, allowing doctors to focus more on their patients.

2024 figures reveal a company in full maturity: **€348 million annual recurring revenue** (+22.5% compared to 2023), but still **€53.8 million EBITDA losses**, although reducing compared to 2023's €87.1 million.

**2025 announces itself as the pivotal year**: Doctolib finally targets **profitability** after twelve years of massive investments. A **stock market introduction** is mentioned for 2025 or 2026, which could be one of French Tech's most anticipated IPOs.

## Economic Model Centered on Professionals

Contrary to popular belief, **99% of Doctolib's revenue comes from healthcare professional subscriptions**, not from patients who use the platform for free. With a subscription at €129 including tax per month for medical practices, Doctolib now equips **300,000 healthcare professionals** and **1,700 establishments** in Europe.

## Challenges and Future Perspectives

Despite its success, Doctolib faces several challenges. **Competition** intensifies with actors like DocPlanner in Europe or French alternatives like GPS Santé offering more attractive rates. The risk of **medicine uberization** and **data protection** questions remain major concerns.

The company bets on **artificial intelligence** to maintain its lead, with projects like the intelligent answering machine planned for 2025. European expansion continues, with **45 million users in France**, **10 million in Germany** and **5 million in Italy**.

## Conclusion: An Exemplary French Success Story

From Parisian startup to European unicorn, Doctolib embodies French entrepreneurship success in digital health. In twelve years, the company raised nearly **€900 million**, revolutionized medical appointment booking for millions of Europeans and created thousands of jobs.

Today valued at **€5.8 billion**, Doctolib prepares to cross a new step with the profitability objective in 2025 and a possible stock market introduction. A trajectory confirming French Tech's potential to create European champions in strategic sectors like health.
