    In a real Jekyll environment, you would get the user's IP from the server.
    For local development or GitHub Pages, this is a placeholder.
    You might need a server-side script or a service to get the actual IP.
    For this example, we'll simulate it or assume it's passed in some way.

    This is a simplified check. In a production environment, you'd use a more robust method
    to get the client's IP and compare it securely.
    For GitHub Pages, direct server-side IP checking isn't possible.
    This would typically be handled by a reverse proxy (like Nginx) or a CDN (like Cloudflare).
    For the purpose of this Jekyll site, we'll assume the IP check happens client-side
    or via a build-time mechanism if deployed with a custom server.
