# Project: Modernization of the Projects Page

## Goal
To transform the `projects.html` page from a simple list into an interactive and visually richer grid of cards, aligning with the existing aesthetic of the site.

## Phase 1: Existing Analysis (Completed)

### 1. Data Analysis (`_data/projects.yml`)
- Projects are defined with fields such as `title`, `date`, `description`, `tagline`, `company`, `role`, `categories`, `hero_image`, `project_url`, `business_context`, `technical_challenges`, `metrics`, `technologies`, and `tags`.
- The `technologies` field is an array of strings (e.g., "PrestaShop", "PHP", "Symfony").
- The `tags` field is an array of objects with `tech` and `category` (e.g., `{ tech: "DevTools", category: "tooling" }`).
- The `technologies` field is suitable for filtering.

### 2. Current Rendering Analysis (`pages/projects.html`, `_includes/project-card.html`, `_includes/project-card-modern.html`)
- `pages/projects.html` already uses a `projects-grid-modern` class for the container and includes `project-card-modern.html` for each project.
- It also contains a filter section (`projects-filters-modern`) that dynamically generates filter buttons based on `project.technologies` from `_data/projects.yml`.
- An inline JavaScript block handles the filtering logic, showing/hiding project cards based on the selected filter.
- `_includes/project-card-modern.html` is designed for a card-like display, including `hero_image`, `title`, `tagline`, `description`, `company`, `role`, and `technologies`. It uses `data-tech` attribute for filtering.
- `_includes/project-card.html` is an older version and is not currently used in `pages/projects.html`.

### 3. Style Analysis (`_sass/variables.scss`, `_sass/projects.scss`)
- `_sass/variables.scss` defines a comprehensive set of colors, typography, spacing, breakpoints, and modern design variables (shadows, gradients, rounded corners).
- `_sass/projects.scss` contains styles for `.projects-main-section`, `.projects-filters-modern`, `.filter-btn-modern`, `.projects-grid-modern`, and `.project-card-modern`.
- The SCSS files already support a grid layout and modern card styling, including hover effects and animations.

## Phase 2: Proposed New Presentation

### 1. Grid Layout
- Utilize existing CSS Grid (`.projects-grid-modern`) for displaying project cards.
- Responsive design: 3-4 columns on large screens, 2 on tablets, 1 on mobile (already implemented in `_sass/projects.scss`).

### 2. Modernized Project Cards
- Each card will contain:
    - Project image (`hero_image`).
    - Project title.
    - Short description.
    - List of "tags" or "badges" for technologies used.
    - Subtle hover effect.
- Inspiration from `_includes/project-card-modern.html` and `_sass/components/_project-cards-modern.scss` (already in use).

### 3. Interactive Filter by Technology
- Filter buttons above the grid, dynamically generated from `_data/projects.yml` technologies (already implemented in `pages/projects.html`).
- Filtering will be done instantly via JavaScript, without page reload (already implemented).
- Adapt and ensure `assets/js/project-filtering.js` works with the new structure (JavaScript moved to this file).

## Phase 3: Implementation Steps

1.  **Data Verification:** Ensure each project in `_data/projects.yml` has a `technologies` field (already present).
2.  **HTML Modification:** Update `pages/projects.html` to integrate the grid structure and filter bar (largely already done).
3.  **SCSS Update:** Modify `_sass/projects.scss` (or create new dedicated files) to style the grid, new cards, and filter buttons, using existing site variables (largely already done).
4.  **JavaScript Logic:** Activate and configure `assets/js/project-filtering.js` to control project display based on selected filter (JavaScript moved to this file).

## Changes Made So Far
- Moved the inline JavaScript filtering logic from `pages/projects.html` to `assets/js/project-filtering.js`.
- Replaced the inline script in `pages/projects.html` with a `<script>` tag linking to `assets/js/project-filtering.js`.

## Next Steps
- Verify that the changes are reflected in the frontend.
- If not, debug and ensure the JavaScript is correctly linked and executed, and that the CSS is applied as expected.
- Continue with any further refinements or additions to the layout or functionality as needed.
