**Deepfakes and disinformation:**
- Ultra-realistic images, videos, audio of people saying/doing things they never did
- Risks: manipulation, fraud, electoral interference
- Example: a CEO deepfake announcing false financial information could trigger a stock market crash

**AI-assisted cyberattacks:**
- Large-scale personalized phishing emails
- Identification and exploitation of software vulnerabilities
- Autonomous cyber-warfare operations

> One expert predicted 2025 could see *"the biggest cyberattack in history, temporarily taking down a significant portion of global infrastructure"*.

**Algorithmic bias and discrimination:**
- Prejudices inherited from training data
- Perpetuation or amplification of inequalities in employment, credit, criminal justice

#### Long-term risks:

- **Loss of control and existential risks** (Geoffrey Hinton: "10-20% chance")
- This perspective, once relegated to science fiction, was now taken seriously by leading researchers and governments

### ⚡ The Delicate Balance Between Innovation and Caution

The central challenge of 2025 was finding the **optimal balance**:

- **Over-regulation** → Slowing advances (assisted education, climate modeling, medical diagnosis)
- **Under-regulation** → Abuse (deepfakes, autonomous weapons, biased hiring algorithms)

> For professionals and businesses, understanding AI governance was no longer optional but **essential**. Certifications in AI ethics and compliance were becoming increasingly valuable.
